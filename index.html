               <h2>What is Accessibility?</h2>
<p>Accessibility is the practice of making websites usable by a wide range of people, including those with disabilities, as well as those using mobile devices or slow network connections. Treating everyone equally and providing equal opportunities, regardless of their abilities or circumstances, is a fundamental aspect of accessibility. Just as physical buildings have accommodations for people with disabilities, websites should be inclusive too. It is not only morally right but also mandated by law in some countries. Building accessible sites has numerous benefits, including improved SEO, better public image, and enhanced usability for various user groups, such as mobile phone users and those on slow networks.</p>

        By failing to consider those with needs different to ourselves, we are telling these people they are not welcome in our app, and therefore that technology as a whole, is not for them. This is not hyperbole--23% of people in the US with a registered disability aren't online at all, that's three times more likely than the general population. â€¦ Software is not made up of cold, unthinking algorithms. Accessibility really plays down to your skills as a developer. Software is a craft in the truest sense of the word, and one of the greatest tools you can have as a craftsperson is empathy for the people who will be using your app. Each one of whom is an individual with different abilities, experiences, knowledge, and circumstances.
