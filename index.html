        By failing to consider those with needs different to ourselves, we are telling these people they are not welcome in our app, and therefore that technology as a whole, is not for them. This is not hyperbole--23% of people in the US with a registered disability aren't online at all, that's three times more likely than the general population. â€¦ Software is not made up of cold, unthinking algorithms. Accessibility really plays down to your skills as a developer. Software is a craft in the truest sense of the word, and one of the greatest tools you can have as a craftsperson is empathy for the people who will be using your app. Each one of whom is an individual with different abilities, experiences, knowledge, and circumstances.
